Experiment No. 5 : Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
a) To display word with the longest length
b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

Experiment No. 7 : Write a Python Program for magic square. A magic square is an n * n matrix of the
integers 1 to n2 such that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same. The
figure given below is an example of magic square for case n=5. In this example, the
common sum is 65.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Experiment No. 8 : Write a Python program that determines the location of a saddle point of matrix if one
exists. An m x n matrix is said to have a saddle point if some entry a[i][j] is the smallest
value in row i and the largest value in j.

Experiment No. 9 : Write a Python Program to compute following computation on matrices :
                  a)Addition of two matrices
                  b)Subtraction of two matrices
                  c)Multiplication of two matrices
                  d)Transpose of a matrix

Experiment No. 13: Write a Python program to maintain club members, sort on roll numbers in ascending
order. Write function “Ternary_Search” to search whether particular student is member
of club or not. Ternary search is modified binary search that divides array into 3 halves
instead of two.

Experiment No. 14: Write a python program to store first year percentage of students in an array.
                      Write function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using:
                      a) Selection Sort
                      b) Bubble Sort and display top five scores

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Experiment No. 16: Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write
                      function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using quick sort
                      and display top five scores.

Experiment No. 20 : The ticket booking system of Cinemax theater has to be implemented using C++ program.
There are 10 rows and 7 seats in each row. Doubly circular linked list has to be
maintained to keep track of free seats at rows. Assume some random booking to start
with. Use array to store pointers (Head pointer) to each row. On demand
a) The list of available seats is to be displayed
b) The seats are to be booked
c) The booking can be cancelled.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Experiment No. 21 : Write C++ program for storing appointment schedule for day. Appointments are booked
randomly using linked list. Set start and end time and min and max duration for visit slot.

Write functions for-
A) Display free slots B) Book appointment C) Sort list based on time

D) Cancel appointment ( check validity, time bounds, availability)
E) Sort list based on time using pointer manipulation

Experiment No. 25 : A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically,
punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a
droop” is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina
droop” and observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check
for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them
the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with

functions-
a) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack

b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Experiment No. 26 : In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as
(),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well
parenthesized or not.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Experiment No. 29 : Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the
creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use
priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++
program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Experiment No. 31 : A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be

made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one-
dimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and

delete elements from either end of the deque.

Experiment No. 32 : Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served
basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system
using circular queue using array.
